1. Question: Can you give detailed information about the actors:
- Students apply through the Erasmus portal, Exchange Office sends the applying student information to coordinators, to Exchange Coordinator Yelda. That means, the excel file you see in the slides is sent to them.
- Students are selected manually by Department coordinators, sometimes Yelda has to calculate the points and sends this file to the Department coordinators
- Yelda contacts with the students in the backup list if some of the selected students cancel their applications, this communication happens via email or via telephone.
- Yelda nominates the students and contacts with the other university, acceptance letters comes, students apply to the other university, Yelda tracks learning agreements, preapproval forms
- Rarely students do not get accepted to the abroad university, very rare situation

2. Question: What is the most difficult part of the process for you:
- Contacting with students via email or telephone for preapprovals
- Document chaos
